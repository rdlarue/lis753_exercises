      <div class="panel">
        <p>October 29, 2020</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Who can vote by mail in Illinois?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Any voter registered in Illinois. <a href="https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx">Check your registration status.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Do I need an excuse to vote by mail?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Does Illinois have absentee voting too?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No.<br>Illinois stopped using the term “absentee” in 2016. The terms “absentee” and “vote-by-mail” are often used interchangeably, but there is no difference in Illinois.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How do I return my ballot after I get it?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>You can mail it, deliver it in person to the office of your local election authority, or drop it in a <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/VoteByMailBallotDropBoxLocations.aspx?MID=0DjRa0Y9V6U%3d&T=637370908160225449">secure dropbox.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is the deadline for returning a mail ballot?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Ballots sent through the U.S. Postal Service must be postmarked <b>on or before November 3rd.</b><br>
        Voters can deposit ballots into a secure drop box until the close of polls at 7 p.m. on November 3rd. <br>
        Ballots must arrive at the office of the local election authority by Nov. 17 to be counted.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Does the voter have to pay postage to mail back a ballot?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This varies between election jurisdictions. <br>
        Some provide postage-prepaid envelopes to return ballots and others require that the voter pay for postage. <br>
        Your mail ballot will contain instructions on postage.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">If I don’t put enough postage on my ballot, will it be returned to sender?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No. The U.S. Postal Service will deliver all ballots it receives.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Can someone else deliver my mail ballot in person to my local election authority office?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes. But the voter and the person delivering the ballot must fill out a wavier on the ballot envelope acknowledging third-party delivery.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">My mail ballot got damaged and I can’t mark it. What should I do?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Contact your local election authority immediately.<br>
          If time allows, you may receive a replacement ballot. If there is not enough time to deliver a new ballot, you can hand in the damaged ballot at an early voting location or polling place on Election Day and vote in person.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">If there is a problem with my ballot after I return it, will I have a chance to fix it so that it will be counted?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Voters will be notified within 2 days if their ballot is rejected.<br>
        If there is an issue with a signature, the voter will be given the opportunity to submit a statement that the ballot was completed and sent by the voter in order to have the ballot counted. <br>
        If the ballot is damaged or arrives improperly sealed, the voter will be given options including voting in person or reissuing a mail ballot if time permits.<br>
        <b>A damaged or unsealed ballot that arrives after Nov. 3 cannot be fixed.</b></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What if I request a mail ballot but decide I’d rather vote in person?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Take your ballot with you to an early voting site or your polling place on Election Day and give it to an election judge. Your mail ballot will be voided, and you will receive a regular ballot.<br>
        If you have not yet received your mail ballot, you will be asked to sign a waiver certifying you have not received your ballot. You will then be issued a regular ballot.<br>
        If you received your mail ballot but lost it, you may sign a wavier certifying you have not yet voted in this election. You will then be issued a replacement ballot.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Will the increase in voting by mail in Illinois mean we won’t know the election results on election night?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Most likey. <br>As of Oct. 5, more than 2 million mail ballots had been requested. Election authorities in Illinois are allowed to process vote-by-mail ballots as they receive them, but they can’t calculate any totals until polls close at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3. On election night, voters will likely see the counts for all mail ballots that were received and processed before Election Day. <b>Mail-in ballots have until Nov 17 to be counted.</b><br>
        The State Board of Elections consistently posts <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/PreElectionCounts.aspx?MID=l0hlXuSrKL0%3d&T=637371605186379268">the number of unreturned mail ballots</a> reported by election authorities statewide. This allows voters to see the potential for vote totals to change for both national and local elections. </p>
